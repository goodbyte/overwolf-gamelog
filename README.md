# overwolf-gamelog

Gamelog is another Overwolf app that I made, this time for the PUBG Developers Challenge (2019), unfortunately I couldn't win but I learned a couple things on the way.

## Description

If you had the chance to try Battlelog (Battlefield Games) in the past, then Gamelog will be a familiar concept, in other words, is a social/gaming platform in which you can keep track of you and your friends stats, share your thoughts, keep yourself updated with the latest news, and much more...
